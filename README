=====================================================

FARS is a resolution/paramodulation theorem prover which 
mainly employs the set of support strategy, along with 
hyperresolution, which is a special case of semantic 
resolution. It is designed to prove theorems expressed 
in first-order predicate logic with equality. Given the 
axioms and the negated conclusion as clauses1 , FARS tries 
to prove it by resolution-refutation method. Furthermore, 
all of the proofs in FARS are refutations (by contradiction).

The inference rules in FARS are generally based on 
resolution (with factorization) and paramodulation. 
In particular, FARS employs as inference rules binary 
resolution and hyperresolution. Additionally, equational 
deduction is done with binary paramodulation. Other 
attributes of FARS includes also forward and backward 
subsumption.

To run FARS on an input, you just provide the file name
and run 'prove-file' in 'main.rkt', like below:

(prove-file "solved/LION.THM")
