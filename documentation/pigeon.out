proof-found! F is derived.

From 15 and 4, generate -> 55 - ~p16(a) | p13(a) | p14(a) | p15(a)

From 55 and 5, generate -> 86 - p13(a) | p14(a) | p15(a) | p17(a) | p18(a) | p19(a)

From 35 and 86, generate -> 89 - p13(a) | p15(a) | p17(a) | p19(a)

From 25 and 89, generate -> 90 - p15(a) | p19(a)

From 45 and 90 ---> F
